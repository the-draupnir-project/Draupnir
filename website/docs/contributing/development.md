# Developing Draupnir

This document is a part of our [contributing documentation](./CONTRIBUTING.md),
which you should take a read of if you didn't already.

Draupnir is a TypeScript project that depends on the labour of a
handful of developers, testers and users. The code base is in relatively
good shape, and if you would like to contribute or gain an understanding
of the workings of Draupnir, then please read our [context document](./context.md).

Then you should read our tests, tools and environment [document](./development-environment.md).
As it goes into some details about how to setup your environment
and debug code.

Once you are happy to start writing code, you should glance at our
[code style document](./code-style.md).
