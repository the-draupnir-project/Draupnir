// how to catagorise commands in help?
// one way is to have subcommand tables to group them by and then iterate over the subcommand tables
// what happens to the method that gets all the command in a table flat though?
// i guess there needs to be immediate commands and imported commands
// then we need to figure out how to render documentation, do we want to write that
// in markdown and import it or something? Not sure.
// but we need this because mjolnir-for-all etc.

// alternatively we could just render the help page ourselves
// putting each category out by hand.

// another thing to imagine is if you wanted to generate a link to a page
// where you can browse the documentation.
